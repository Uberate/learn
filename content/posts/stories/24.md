Well it's hard to say something all of a sudden.
Life is allways complicated and hard to live.
We all just have one life night now and most of us aotually don't known how to live.
I've met a part of the world and now I'm back. 
But I still working forward to other new world.
New land and new life. 
The past make me fell like I was just live in a dream. 
And now I wake up and I got nothing but I still hope that I can live in a way that I want and I'll never
give up, not even a moments.
Even though I got nothing right now and can't even get about the future.
I'm just thing for the world.
And Timid, as well, I met a lot of person and now I have to say goodbye, lost of the time, I just act like
a total dork.
I did something wrong and I hurt people.
I'm humble and pathetic.
That's what I think about the past.

我想善良而有趣，
勇敢又温柔的活着。
不被塔巴斯羁绊，
不为金钱所困扰。
自由而洒脱地活着。
希望写下这段话以后，
如果我会再次看到这段文字，
希望我能如愿。
